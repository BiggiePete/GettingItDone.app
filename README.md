# Getting it done. app

the main premise is a site where you can type a thing you want to do, then it takes you to /task/(unique id)
where you can work on your thing, create different subtasks and mark them complete

users should be able to share the link to that page and thus allow collaboration with others

should be as light weight as possible

store the link for 10 days after last activity, allowing users to come back to their project
